This is my second A.I. course project.
In this project we have to use OpenCV in order to:
1. display an image (jpg format)
2. display only the blue channel of the image
3. display it in gray scale
4. smoth the image using Gaussian filter in OpenCV
5. rotate the image 90 degrees
6. change the width of the image but keep the height
7. edge detection in OpenCv
8. segmentation in OpenCV
9. face detection in OpenCV
10. show the first five frames of a video in .avi format
